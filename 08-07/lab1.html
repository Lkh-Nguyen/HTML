            <p>Mnder most conditions, apple trees Will set more fruit than needed for a full crop Most
            iapple cultivars will retain this heavy set of fruit throughout the growing season
            jesulting in small, poorly colored, low quality fruit. Thinning is the removal of a portion
            iof the crop before it matures on the tree to increase the marketability of the remaining
            Truit and to reduce the biennial bearing tendenc of the tree.</p>
